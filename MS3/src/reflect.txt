I liked these milestones because challenged my skills an are really fun at doing it.
I learned a lot, specially how to find information outiside the academy context to be able to 
solve this project. 

The function that I got stuck for long time was at reording the stations without manual loops, and after doing 
many attempts trying differents functions and logics, finally I could succeed and the feeling of see my results are the 
reason why I like this major.
